# Choices I Made When Creating my Repository and Why :grinning:
1. Boost Software License: I am comfortbale with my code being open and available for everyone to use, as long everyone uses a copyright to give me at least some credit. BSL accomplishes this.
2. I also made the visibility public, so everyone can access and view my code/files. :grin:

@guyer BSL has its own built-in warranty, right? could that be a cause for worry?
